## What is Tasky?

Tasky is a small desktop app that sits in your system tray and keeps track of
**everything you want to get done**: work projects, personal errands, habits,
goals. It also shows **where your time actually goes**.

It is built around one idea: **your to-do list is personal.** It shouldn't
live on someone else's server, need a subscription, or stop working when the
Wi-Fi drops.

## Why Tasky exists

Most task apps want you to sign up, sync to their cloud and pay monthly, and
they hold your data. Tasky takes the opposite approach:

- 🔒 **Private by design.** Everything is stored in a local database on your own PC.
  No telemetry, no analytics, no servers.
- 📴 **No internet needed.** Tasky never connects to the internet. It works on a
  plane, behind a firewall, anywhere.
- 🧍 **Not just for projects.** Use it for your own life: daily routines,
  reminders, learning goals, side projects, chores.
- 📈 **For personal improvement.** Tasky tracks time spent and tasks completed so you
  can see your own progress and work habits. Only you see the reports.
- ⚡ **Simple and fast.** One click (or one shortcut) adds a task. No setup, no
  tutorial, no clutter.

## Features

### ✅ Tasks
- **One-click add** from the main window, or **Win + Shift + T** from anywhere
- Title, description, due date and **task numbers** (`#012`) for quick reference
- **Groups** with colours (Work, Personal, Health… whatever you like) and one-click group filters
- **Today / This Week / All** views, plus instant search by title, number or description
- **Recurring tasks**: daily, weekly or monthly; the next one is created when you finish the current one
- **Drag and drop** to reorder your list
- **Recycle bin**: deleted tasks can be restored for 30 days
- Overdue tasks are highlighted in red, so nothing slips quietly

### ⏱ Time tracking
- **One toggle** starts the timer on a task, and pause/resume is one click
- **Pauses automatically** when you are idle for 5 minutes, lock your PC, put it to
  sleep, shut down or quit, so your reports stay honest
- Resumes when you come back from idle or unlock
- Add time by hand for tasks you forgot to track
- A **floating mini-widget** shows the running timer while you work in other apps

### 🔔 Reminders
- One-time, daily, weekly (pick the weekday) or monthly (pick the day) reminders, with an optional end date
- Quick **"remind me in 5 / 10 / 30 / 60 minutes"** from any task
- Themed pop-up notifications with **snooze**, custom accent colour and notification sound
- A **missed-notifications inbox**, so reminders that fired while you were away aren't lost
- Reminders and snoozes survive restarts

### 📝 Notes
- Quick notes with **tags** and full-text search, for ideas, how-tos and snippets
- One-click copy of a note's text
- **Attach files to notes**: screenshots, PDFs, documents, anything. Add them from the
  note, paste with **Ctrl + V** or drag and drop. Notes with files show a 📎 count in the list

### 📎 Attachments
- Attach files to **tasks and notes**
- Paste screenshots with **Ctrl + V**, drag and drop files, or pick them from disk
- Built-in image viewer with next/previous; other files open in their default app

### 📊 Personal progress reports
- Tasks completed **today, this week and all time**
- **Week-by-week charts** of tasks finished and time spent (browse back through past weeks)
- **Your busiest hours** of the day and an average **weekly time pattern**
- **Top tasks by time**, to see where your hours really go
- **Meeting hours**, detected automatically when a calling app (Teams, Zoom, Skype,
  Webex, Slack, Discord, Google Meet…) is actively using your microphone or camera.
  No calendar access or sign-in needed.
- **App usage**, showing which apps you spend your day in

### 💻 Migrate to another computer
- Move **everything** to a new PC in **one password-protected file**: open and completed
  tasks, groups, notes, reminders, task and note attachments, reports history, recycle bin and settings
- The file is **encrypted with your password** (AES-256), so it is safe on a USB stick or shared drive
- On the new PC, pick the file, enter the password, and Tasky restarts with all your data,
  as if you had never switched computers
- No cloud, no account: the file goes wherever *you* put it

### 🎉 Small things that make it nice
- A celebration with confetti when you finish a task, plus a shareable "completed" banner
  (saved to your Desktop and copied to the clipboard)
- **Dark and light themes** that follow your Windows setting automatically
- Lives quietly in the **system tray**, and opening it again just brings the window forward

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or later, 64-bit
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) to build from source

### Build and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muaa3405-spec/tasky.git
cd tasky
dotnet run --project Tasky/Tasky.csproj
```

That's it. No accounts, keys or configuration. On first start Tasky creates its own
empty database.

To make a self-contained build you can copy to any Windows PC (no .NET install needed there):

```bash
dotnet publish Tasky/Tasky.csproj -c Release
```

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for building the installer with Inno Setup.

## Where your data lives

Everything stays inside your Windows user profile. Nothing is ever uploaded.

| What | Location |
|------|----------|
| Tasks, notes, reminders, reports (SQLite) | `%AppData%\Tasky\tasky.db` |
| Task attachments | `%AppData%\Tasky\Attachments\<task id>\` |
| Note attachments | `%AppData%\Tasky\Attachments\notes\<note id>\` |
| Settings | `%AppData%\Tasky\settings.json` |
| Error logs | `%LocalAppData%\Tasky\logs\` |
| Safety copy made before an import | `%LocalAppData%\Tasky\before-import\` |

These folders are readable only by your Windows account (and administrators).
**Remove all data** by deleting `%AppData%\Tasky`.

### What gets recorded on your PC

To power the reports, Tasky also keeps two local logs:

- **Meeting detection** checks every 30 seconds whether a calling app is actively
  using your microphone or camera, and records only the start and end time of each
  meeting. It never records audio or video.
- **App usage** records which app is in the foreground (by app name, not what's
  inside the window) and for how long.

Both stay in the local database above and never leave your computer.

## Moving to a new computer

1. On the old PC: **Settings → Migrate to another computer → Open → Export from this computer**.
2. Create a password (at least 8 characters) and choose where to save the file
   (for example a USB stick). It is named like `Tasky-migration-2026-10-21.taskymigration`.
3. Install Tasky on the new PC and open **Settings → Migrate to another computer → Import on this computer**.
4. Pick the file, enter the password, review what's inside and click **Import and restart Tasky**.

Good to know:

- **The password can't be recovered.** The file is encrypted with it (AES-256-GCM, key
  derived with PBKDF2-SHA256, 600,000 rounds), and nothing about the password is stored.
  A wrong password or a damaged or edited file is refused.
- **Importing replaces the data on that PC.** Whatever Tasky had there before is kept as a
  safety copy in `%LocalAppData%\Tasky\before-import\`.
- Attachments keep working even if your Windows user name is different on the new PC.

## Contributing

Ideas, bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Keep pull requests focused; one fix or feature each.
3. Open a pull request. Every change to `main` is reviewed by the maintainer before it is merged.

Please don't commit build output, your database or personal settings
(`.gitignore` already excludes them).
